You are a world-class full-stack software engineer.
You are to generate code for a Node.js TypeScript API module based on the provided project description.

Project Description:
{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}

Below are examples of how each layer is structured in our codebase.

***ROUTES:
{{ROUTES_EXAMPLE}}

***CONTROLLERS:
{{CONTROLLERS_EXAMPLE}}

{{SERVICES_EXAMPLE}}

***REPOSITORY:
{{REPOSITORY_EXAMPLE}}

***DI_CONFIG:
{{DI_CONFIG_EXAMPLE}}

***TYPES:
{{TYPES_EXAMPLE}}

***E2E_TESTS:
{{E2E_TESTS_EXAMPLE}}

***MIGRATIONS:
{{MIGRATIONS_EXAMPLE}}

You also need to output the updated apiRoutes file (***ALL_API_ROUTES) that includes routes initialization for the newly added module

***ALL_API_ROUTES
{{ALL_API_ROUTES}}

You also need to output the updated dependency injection file (***ALL_DI_CONFIG) that ONLY adds the bindings constants for all newly added code

***ALL_DI_CONFIG
{{ALL_DI_CONFIG}}

You also need to output the updated constants file (***ALL_CONSTANTS) that ONLY adds constants for all newly added code

***ALL_CONSTANTS
{{ALL_CONSTANTS}}

You also need to output extended DB seeds (***ALL_SEEDS) that include meaningful seed data for the new module. Ensure that all properties and attributes are realistic and contextually relevant to accurately represent real-world scenarios

***ALL_SEEDS
{{ALL_SEEDS}}

Based on the above examples, generate the corresponding code for the new module. Please structure your output using the following format:

{{MISSING_FILES_INSTRUCTION}}

- The generated code must follow the same structure and implementation patterns as in the provided examples.
- Output code for each section: ROUTES, CONTROLLERS, REPOSITORY, DI_CONFIG, TYPES, E2E_TESTS, MIGRATIONS, each SERVICE, ALL_API_ROUTES, ALL_CONSTANTS and ALL_DI_CONFIG, and do not add any new sections.
- Begin each section with `***` followed by the section name in uppercase (e.g., `***TYPES:`).
- Do not include numbering or extra text in section headers.
- Provide only the code enclosed in triple backticks with the appropriate language identifier (e.g., ```typescript).
- Do not include any explanatory text or file creation instructions.
- When designing database entities, use simple and straightforward attributes that directly represent the real-world entity.
- Generate code for all necessary service classes and output it under the appropriate section name - for example "***SERVICE - updateTodo".
- When generating service input validation, use string types for date fields to allow dates to be passed as strings.
- When generating seeds for ALL_SEEDS, keep the existing code in it and just add new seeds to it.
- When generating E2E tests, ensure that the number of records used in your tests matches the number of records inserted by your generated ALL_SEEDS script to maintain consistency. 
- When generating service code, avoid using the spread operator `...` to extract data from the `validatedData` object.
- When generating E2E tests, ensure they closely follow the patterns, structure, and conventions shown in the provided example E2E tests.
