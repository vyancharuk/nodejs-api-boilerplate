You received the following error after compilation: {{ERROR_TEXT}}

Based on the above-generated code and error, output ONLY the module code that is needed to fix the error. Please structure your output using the following format:

- Begin each section with `***` followed by the section name in uppercase (e.g., `***TYPES:`).
- Do not include any new sections.
- Do not include numbering or extra text in the section headers.
- Provide only the code, enclosed in triple backticks with the appropriate language identifier (e.g., ```typescript).
- Do not include any explanatory text or file creation instructions.
- Generate code for necessary service classes and output it under the appropriate section name - for example "***SERVICE - updateTodo".
- When generating E2E tests, keep in mind that the database contains records inserted by your generated ALL_SEEDS script.
